# odin-landing-recipes
This is a project given to students of The Odin Project. In this assignment I'll will be demonstrating everything has I've learned so far in the foundations course, and create a landing page for a website. This will require understanding of HTML and CSS, along with flexbox which is used to organise items on page in the box-model.
